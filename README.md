Responsive Landing Page with Hamburger Menu

This is a modern, responsive landing page featuring a clean design with a sticky navigation bar that adapts to different screen sizes. The page uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic user experience.

Key Features:

Sticky Navbar: The navigation bar stays fixed at the top of the page while scrolling, ensuring easy access to the menu at all times.

Responsive Design: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes, from large desktop monitors to mobile devices.

Hamburger Menu: On smaller screens (below 768px), the navigation links are hidden and revealed when the user clicks on the hamburger icon, making the layout more compact and user-friendly.

Smooth Transitions: The transition effects on hover and when toggling the hamburger menu provide a smooth and visually appealing experience.

Technologies Used:

HTML: Structure of the page and content.

CSS: Styling and responsiveness, including flexbox for layout and media queries for responsiveness.

JavaScript: Implements the hamburger menu toggle functionality and adds a scroll effect to change the navbar style when scrolling.

How It Works:

Navbar: On desktop, the navbar displays links horizontally. On smaller screens, the links are hidden and can be accessed through the hamburger menu.

Scroll Effect: As the user scrolls, the navbar changes its background color for better contrast and visibility.

Mobile-Friendly: The design is optimized for mobile, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

Use Case:

This template is ideal for creating landing pages or websites with a simple yet responsive design, suitable for portfolios, blogs, or business websites.
